<div class="title"><h3>Testimony of the week</h3></div>


<p><p>My Name is Sister Blessing. I had not understood the meaning of the scripture which says &#8220;He neither sleeps nor slumbers&#8221;, until the first of June 2015, when God saved me and my family from a ghastly motor accident.</p>
<p>I traveled to Bamenda for holidays, but I was forced to come back to Buea, because my child was sick. While in Bamenda, I had a dream in which Papa Eugine appeared to me and said &#8220;Blessing am angry because you traveled without informing me&#8221; ( I have never met Papa one on one, and I am sure he does not know my name. But in that dream, he called me by name). Meanwhile on two successive nights, I have dreamed that while traveling back to Buea, we had an accident and my mum died. Finally on sunday night, Papa appeared to me in a dream again and said &#8220;Blessing am angry because you traveled without informing me, But I will pray for you&#8221;. Then in the dream he prayed for me and left. The next day, while traveling back to Buea, our bus had a fatal accident around the Dschang hill. Our 70 seat bus had a face to face collision with another one. Many people died, our driver&#8217;s corpse had to be chopped into pieces before it could be pulled out of the wreckage.</p>
<p>I thank God because I came out without a single scratch. My mother had some slight injuries, but now, less than a week later, she is healed. My little boy also had this scratch on his forehead, but he is fine.</p>
<p>I just bless God for His grace upon Papa Eugine. I pray that he lives long to fulfill God&#8217;s mandate over his life.</p>
